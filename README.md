E Boella et al's particle in cell example python code. Includes associated tutorial document 

This is Elisabetta Boella et al's EM particle in cell code tutorial + tutorial files.

The tutorial follows on from the CI lecture CI-SWA-322.

The tutorial files are all written in Python and require a Python2 environment?, Python3 and a C compiler (such as GCC).

Questions to e.boella@lancaster.ac.uk.

The code is from the github repository https://github.com/eboella/Python-ePIC.

A local copy is within the Bmad VM and this repository is also available on my github.

The tutorial files need to be ran + tutorial followed.
